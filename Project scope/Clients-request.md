-----------------------------------------------------
Question --- how do we handle  vidoe metting cancellations 


Amdin side 

Admin -----------------------------------------------

    Allow admin to flag fake profiles, or other violations.
Enable moderators/admins to review and take action (ban, suspend, warn)

    Profile Pictures: Multiple atleast (6) photos with moderation for authenticity.


   Backend Moderation System:

Priority Queue (urgent reports like threats get fast-tracked)

Moderator Dashboard (tools to review evidence, ban users, track history)

Appeal Process (allow wrongly flagged users to contest)
